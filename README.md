# code_refactor
First homework for Coding BootCamp

For this assignment I was given a working code that seemed to have several containers, links that were not working, and tags or elements that were not semantic.
I first began cleaning to code by organizing some of the tags and testinig the code in a web browser with each touch up.
I made sure to see which links were working and which might be broken and came to find one of the links that was in the navigation pane that did not seem to be written correctly.
The code for both the html and css file should be easier to read and navigate through and the page should also load faster now that the code is a little more condensed.

Below you can find a live link of the project along with a screenshot of the project.
